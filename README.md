# NEWS Reader

### NEWS Reader is a project analyzing NEWS thoroughly to help people to <ins>READ NEWS PROPERLY.</ins>

Today, we are surrounded by...

## What is the problem?

- POLITICS : boring!! too many political jargons
- ABROAD : biased!! Conveying only dramatic disasters without normal life
- CELEBRITY : Just for eye candy! No purpose more than serving people's gossiping desire
- DISASTER : Exaggerate. Focuses on magnitude, unintentionally feel unsafe

## How to solve?

- POLITICS : Get most used political jargons, top 100 and give explanation
- ABROAD : Get "disaster news / all abroad news" (proportion of disaster news)
- CELEBRITY : Get titles from latest 100 ~ 1000 news of celebrity
- DISASTER : Get news with "die, kill, murder..." in title and create visual representation(maps, charts, graphs) for realistic understanding of all disasters
