# NEWS Analyzer

## ⚠️ EDIT(Aug.30.2021) - Archived the repo, but not the idea.

### NEWS Analyzer is a project analyzing NEWS thoroughly to help people to <ins>READ NEWS PROPERLY.</ins>

It(News) fails to disclose that it does not merely "report" on the world.

Original purpose...
뉴스 헤드라인(각 분야별)의 제목, 내용의 데이터를 취합/분석하여 같은 것이 반복되는 뉴스의 위험성과 뉴스의 허영을 알린다.

## What is the problem?

The purpose of the News seems to be report facts fast and precisely. But it is naive thought because nothing can be not biased, even the facts. Talking about certain fact means the person chose to talk about "it" and not something else. Therefore, by analyzing News and News reader, we can read/watch news properly.

## How to solve?

- Analyzing pattern of fixed and repeating topics
- Get quantity proportion of categories
- Get user traffic proportion of categories

## Source

Main resource : The News: A User's Manual(by Alain de Botton)

Uses no frameworks (using only vanilla JS)

## After

This project had fundamental obstacle which is...
"Human language is extremely ambiguous and abstract".
Therefore even though the idea of this project alarms people for better world, I close this project.
